# This is a placeholder for the model architecture diagram
# The actual PNG file should be generated from the Mermaid diagram in ARCHITECTURE.md
# 
# To generate:
# 1. Copy the "FastEnhancedTransformer Architecture" Mermaid code from ARCHITECTURE.md
# 2. Use https://mermaid.live/ to render and export as PNG
# 3. Replace this file with the generated PNG
#
# Diagram shows:
# - Input Processing (Tokenizer, Embeddings, Positional Encoding)
# - Encoder Stack (4 layers with self-attention)
# - Decoder Stack (4 layers with cross-attention)
# - Output Processing (Linear projection, Softmax)
# - Attention Mechanisms (Multi-head attention details)
